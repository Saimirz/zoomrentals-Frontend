This is the front end of ZoomRentals.


ZoomRentals is a site that was created to help consumers to find a more efficient way of cars that they want to rent.

To create this frontend portion, I used visual studio code. Visual Studio code offers many different tools and methods of creating an app
and works very well with react. Node.js was also a tool that was used in the creation of this app.

The application was built in a way so that users can come and enter the dates of when they would like to rent a car for, and then search the name of the car and see if it is available. If it is availabe, it would then display all the information linked to the car. It would also show your own information after you had finished putting it in. Like that your information would be there and you can make sure that everything is correct and that the rental can actually go through.

Although i was not able to complete it in this project, next time i would like to actually implement those things. The site would be a lot more pretiier and better looking. You would be able to see all the available cars and other alternatives incase something wasn't available.
